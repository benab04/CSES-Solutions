# CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the CSES Problem Set implemented in C++. I'm actively working on solving more problems and will keep adding solutions as I progress.

## Current Progress

Solutions are organized by problem categories:

- **Dynamic Programming**

  - Dice Combinations
  - Minimizing Coins
  - Coin Combinations I & II

- **Graph Algorithms**

  - Building Roads
  - Building Teams
  - Counting Rooms
  - Labyrinth
  - Message Route
  - Round Trip

- **Tree Algorithms**
  - Subordinates

## Usage

Each solution is written in C++ and can be compiled using a C++ compiler.

### Quick Git Push

I've included a `gitpush.bat` script for quick commits. Use it like this:

```bash
./gitpush "Your commit message"
```
