# CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the CSES Problem Set implemented in C++. I'm actively working on solving more problems and will keep adding solutions as I progress.

## Current Progress

Solutions are organized by problem categories:

- **DP**

  - Coin Combinations I
  - Coin Combinations II
  - Dice Combinations
  - Minimizing Coins
  - Removing Digits

- **Graphs**

  - Building Roads
  - Building Teams
  - Counting Rooms
  - Labyrinth
  - Message Route
  - Round Trip

- **Trees**

  - Subordinates

## Usage

Each solution is written in C++ and can be compiled using a C++ compiler.

### Quick Git Push

I've included a gitpush.bat script for quick commits. Use it like this:

`cmd
gitpush "Your commit message"
`

This single command will add all changes, commit with your message, and push to the main branch.

## Work in Progress

This is an ongoing project. I'll continue to add more solutions as I solve them. Feel free to check back for updates.
