# CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the CSES Problem Set implemented in C++. I'm actively working on solving more problems and will keep adding solutions as I progress.

## Current Progress

Solutions are organized by problem categories:
- **Additional Problems (1)**

  - Removing Digits II

- **DP (6)**

  - Coin Combinations I
  - Coin Combinations II
  - Dice Combinations
  - Grid Paths I
  - Minimizing Coins
  - Removing Digits

- **Graphs (6)**

  - Building Roads
  - Building Teams
  - Counting Rooms
  - Labyrinth
  - Message Route
  - Round Trip

- **Trees (1)**

  - Subordinates

## Usage

Each solution is written in C++ and can be compiled using a C++ compiler.

### Quick Git Push

I've included a gitpush.bat script for quick commits. Use it like this:

`
./gitpush <Your commit message without quotes>
`

This single command will modify the README, add all changes, commit with your message, and push to the main branch.

### Build and Run a .cpp file using a single command line

Running a CPP file in VSCode was giving a hell lot of issues, so the build.bat is a temporary workaround to quickly build and get the file running. 

Use it in the same directory as the file like this:

`
./build FileName.cpp
`

This will build an executable named FileName.exe and run it instantly.
